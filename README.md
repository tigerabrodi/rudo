# What is this?

A template for creating libraries for ReactJS.

# Notes

Refer to this blog post to understand the structure of the library: [Chronological guide: Building & Publishing a React Library](https://tigerabrodi.blog/chronological-guide-building-and-publishing-a-react-library)

# How to use this template?

You can just fork it I guess?

Then start building your own library.

Check `package.json` for the stuff you need to change.
